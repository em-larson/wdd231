            <p>Hey there! We're the founders and main team behind the Ogden D&D Compendium. What began as a small
                adventuring party of friends has grown into a thriving community that connects players, forms new
                groups, and helps beginners dive into the world of Dungeons & Dragons. Whether you're a seasoned dungeon
                master
                or someone who's always wanted to roll their first d20, we're here to help you find your party, learn
                the
                ropes, and start your next great campaign right here in Ogden.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Are you new to D&D? Here are a few things that you will need in order to get started.</p>
            <h3>Dice</h3>
            <img src="images/dice0.webp" alt="dice">
            <p>Dice are vital to playing a game of D&D. If you are playing online, then many platforms have a built in
                feature that will roll dice for you. But if you want that satisfying clickty-clack of physical dice then
                a set of dice is calling for you. You can find these in nearly any game shop, or buy local by going to
                the store tab of this website.</p>
            <h3>Your Character</h3>
            <img src="images/charactersheet.webp" alt="character sheet">
            <p>When building your character, there are plenty of resources online. Keep track of your character by using
                roll20, D&D Beyond, or physical paper. You will want this with you everytime that you play. </p>
            <h3>The Extras</h3>
            <p>This is all you really need to get started, but most people as they play D&D enjoy collecting the
                nik-naks as well. You can continue to flush out your collection of items with dice trays, dice jails,
                chacter tokens and so forth. These are not nessessary, but this is a game and it is meant to be fun, so
                have fun!</p>
